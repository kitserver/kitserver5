2021-06-28
----------
v5.7.1
- kserv: fixes for the following issues, introduced in 5.7.0:
    - possible "2nd-match-crash" (where first match works, but second may crash before starting)
    - Edit mode correction for "Edit Player Number" page


2021-06-27
----------
v5.7.0
- kserv: supporting different models for player/goalkeeper kits
  on the same team. (This removes the internal limitation that
  the game had, where PL and GK had to use the same model, or
  otherwise the kits would be distorted on the goalkeeper)
  Again, thanks to Ciais, who advocated for this feature :-)
- bootserver: optimizations for HD boot support


2021-05-04
----------
v5.6.3
- bootserver: support for HD boot images in GDB. Thanks, Ciais!

2020-08-25
----------
v5.6.2
- kserv: added support for mini-kit rendering of PES6 kit models
- kserv: support for square textures (such as standard 512x512 pes6 kits, 1024x1024, etc.)
