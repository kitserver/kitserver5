Version 5.0.3


AUTOMATIC BALL PHYSICS OPTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[auto-ball-physics.enabled]:
If set to 1, ball physics are automatically changed according to selected weather and season:
- Summer / fine  = Standard ball physics
- Summer / rainy = Rainy ball physics
- Winter / fine  = Hard pitch ball physics
- Winter / rainy = Rainy ball physics
- Winter / snow  = Snow ball physics
If set to 0, standard ball physics are used for all weathers and seasons.

[random-fine-ball-physics.enabled]:
* For this setting to work, [auto-ball-physics.enabled] must be set to 1
If set to 1, standard or hard pitch ball physics are randomly assigned each match to fine weather
using different probabilities according to the selected season:
- Summer = [hard-pitch.summer.probability]  # Example: 33 = 33% chance of hard pitch ball physics
- Winter = [hard-pitch.winter.probability]  # Example: 60 = 60% chance of hard pitch ball physics
The resulting weather/season assignments are as follows:
- Summer / fine  = Standard or hard pitch ball physics (according to set summer probability)
- Summer / rainy = Rainy ball physics
- Winter / fine  = Standard or hard pitch ball physics (according to set winter probability)
- Winter / rainy = Rainy ball physics
- Winter / snow  = Snow ball physics
If set to 0, default [auto-ball-physics.enabled] assignments are used (see above).


TWEAKED CONDITION ARROWS OPTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[tweaked-condition-arrows.enabled]:
If set to 1, immediately before each match the condition arrows that affect a player's ratings are
changed for both teams according to the chosen condition replacement:
- Excellent = [excellent-condition.replacement]  # Example: good = Good form replaces Excellent form
- Good      = [good-condition.replacement]
- Normal    = [normal-condition.replacement]
- Poor      = [poor-condition.replacement]
- Terrible  = [terrible-condition.replacement]   # Example: poor = Poor form replaces Terrible form
* Note that this only works for actual matches, inside League/ML menus and in Training Mode the
condition arrows will remain as default.
If set to 0, the game's default condition arrows are always used.


ADDITIONAL SUBSTITUTION IN EXTRA TIME
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[additional-sub-extra-time.enabled]:
If set to 1, if a match goes to extra time (full length, silver goal or golden goal), an
additional substitution is available for both teams, regardless of already used ones.
* This setting simulates the new substitution rule (as used at the 2018 FIFA World Cup)
If set to 0, no additional substitution is added, meaning teams will have the set number of
substitutions for the entirety of the match, even if a match goes to extra time.


BALL PHYSICS
~~~~~~~~~~~~

[ball-player.proximity.*]:  # Default = 256
Controls how responsive the player is to receiving the ball.
It also affects the distance the player is to the ball at first touch.

[ball.gravity.*]:  # Default = 188
Self-explanatory, only a flat-earther wouldn't know what gravity does :)

[ball.global-bounce-stick.*]:  # Default = -28
Controls how much the ball sticks to the ground when rolling.

[ball.spin-termination-speed.*]:  # Default = -376
Controls how the much ball spins when touched by a foot during a player's run.
* If the value is changed too dramatically, then the ball will either stop to a halt in a very
unrealistic way, or keep on rolling like Neymar

[ball.bounce-stick-frequency.*]:  # Default = -0.00390625
Controls how much the ball will either bounce or stick to the ground when in a long pass.
In effect this controls how much the ball bobbles during a long pass across the ground.
* This value is very sensitive so should be adjusted in very very small increments

[ball.topspin.*]:  # Default = 4551266
Controls how much the ball in flight stays low or high.
* A low topspin value will send the ball higher into the sky quicker when in flight, and a high
topspin value will keep the ball down in flight for longer

[ball.air-resistance.*]:  # Default = 1400000
Controls how fast the ball travels through the air.

[ball.touch-move-rate.*]:  # Default = 0.003472222248
Controls how much the ball will roll away from the player when it's touched by the player's foot.

[ball.retardation-rate.*]:  # Default = 0.01041666698
Controls how fast the ball will slow down to a halt after being touched by the player's foot.

[player.anim-speed.*]:  # Default = 0.0009765625
Controls the animation speed of the players.
* Not recommended to be modified, but if skating issues persist, then change this value in very
small increments
