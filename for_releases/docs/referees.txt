ADDITIONAL REFEREES IN EXHIBITION MODE OPTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[additional-refs-exhibition.enabled]:
If set to 1, additional referees originally only available in League/Cup/ML modes will be added to Exhibition
mode, with the total cumulative number (original + additional referees) set by the following option:
- Total = [additional-refs-exhibition.total]  # Default = 10
* This value must be no lower than 10 and no higher than 22
If set to 0, only the default 10 referees will be available in Exhibition mode.
* These additional referees can only be selected individually, as setting Referee to Random will only randomly
choose between the default 10 ones
